  REALTODO 
============

- Make PolSAR classifiers easier / update them (started)
- Add EMPLR classifier (started)
- Check / remove some of the multifile stuff
- Check display of change detection results
- Advanced usage of RAT from the bash + nice tutorial (started)

========
  TODO 
========

General:

- Transform rit file into an xml file (started, make it easy to add new parameters, information, etc.)
- Change size of the main rat window using mouse (started)
- Handling of system parameters (sensor & orbit) (started)
- Generation of classification report files
- extension of block_inv and block_det for 6x6 and 8x8 matrices
- contrast adjustment (done, but can be made better)
- rotate left / right
- Include some single-channel routines for supervised classification, analyis etc.
- multitemporal analysis / multifiles (starded, diploma)

IO:

- Import file generated using ROI_PAC (started)
- ENVI import for BIL
- More input formats  like AIRSAR, SIR-C, etc. (ongoing)

SAR:

- Adapt RefLee and IDAN filters to stacked amplitude imagess
- include even more speckle filter (Weirbull, Wavelet...)
- include some more edge detectors (ML)

Polarimetry:

- symmetrisation during loading
- span only on certain data types
- Polarimetric distributed target analysis
- Polarimetric noise reduction (eigendecomposition)
- Wishart: logging of convergence of cluster centres

Interferometry:

- Coherence bias removal
- construct insar pair should work also for 2 different image sizes
- ellipsoid flat-earth estimation (started)
- Orbit analysis for calculating flat-earth and range filter parameters
- Unwrapping (started)
- slant range noise filter
- Anaglyph calculation

PolInSAR

- Coherence bias removal
- Add Tomography routines

documentation started
Antenna correction

============
  FINISHED
============

- adaptive range filtering
- Polarimetric calibration routines
- Full support of 2 (partial polarimetry) channels (GIVEN UP!)
- zoom should always magnify (show) individual pixels
- Scrolling problems (on Windows only)
- No of looks calculation
- include some more edge detectors (Canny)
- New progress bar with a cancel button (to cancel the current operation)
- Pass filename to open from UNIX command line (requires small shellscript)
- Cut region should scroll automatically when reaching the window boundaries
- Update preview attachment when window size was changed
- data management routine (started ...)
- enhancement of the select channel routines (started ...)
- Check if file is existing when saving
- Speed up MAP filters 
- ENVISAT import (in work)
- change from a preferences file to a preferences directory
- ask before overwriting an existing file.
- Calculate variation coefficient
- Texture analysis
- switch to correct use of directory separators (PATH_SEP)
- Automatic setting of home and tmp directorys
- replace platform dependent file copy / moves with FILE_COPY/MOVE
- Shaded relief
- GUI on M$-Windows looks very ugly and has errors
- Better E-SAR import
- Pauli decomposition also on matrices
- Wishart classification
- flat-earth from file
- presumming / resize not working correctly on phase values
- Preferences: add '/' if necessary
- include some more speckle filter (Kuan, MAP, Frost, Lee-Sigma)
- remove 'inputfile' in some routines (problems in combination with /called)
- Generic export (no header)
- Freeman - Durden Decomposition (wrong? has to be checked)
- When pressing cancel the path is lost
- Windows pop in forground with every change
- Extract Entropy / Alpha / Anisotropy from combi-file
- progress bar
- extraction of entropy, alpha and anisotropy
- Eigenvalue decomposition into one file, i.e. 4 x 3 x X x Y
- Entalpani decomposition into one file, i.e. 3 x X x Y
- polarimetric Lee-Filter (wrong? have to be checked)
- polarimetric refined Lee-Filter (wrong? have to be checked)
- Undo function
- Projection slant-range ---> ground range
- Adaption to M$-windows ????
- presumming / resize function
- transform integer -> float (easy)
- pulldown-menues: check also for selected menu, not only for selected button
- preferences dialog, for setting values of 'definitions.pro'
- when saving as RAT, info and filetype are not used (they may have changed)
- dialog for editing RAT file information, especially for setting file.type 
- mirror
